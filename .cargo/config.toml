# `target-cpu=native` lets the compiler emit AVX2/AVX-512 instructions for the
# current machine.  This is intentional — rust_dt targets a specific workstation
# and does not need portable binaries.  Remove this file (or override with
# RUSTFLAGS="") if you need to build a binary for a different CPU.
